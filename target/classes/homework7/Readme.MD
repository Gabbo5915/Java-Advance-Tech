##Purpose
Verify the efficient of single thread with multiple thread

##Class file
We have two different class: one is for single thread, another is for multiple thread

##conclusion
When we need to create just a little number of string, one thread is more efficient.
But when the number is increased to greater than 1000000, multiple thread is more efficient.
