We have 6 source file for date.
Summary.txt is for total information.
Day 1 is for data of 1 day
Day 5 is for the data of 5 days
...
Day 30 is for the data of 30 days

I defined two search function.
One is for Lucene search and another one is for brute force search

So I use different size data file to simulate the response time for different days.

Details explanation can be seen in class file.
